        <p class="text">Sometimes I feel like throwing my hands up in the air
          I know I can count on you
          Sometimes I feel like saying "Lord I just don't care"
          But you've got the love I need
          To see me through</p>
        <p class="text">Sometimes it seems the going is just too rough
          And things go wrong no matter what I do
          Now and then it seems that life is just too much
          But you've got the love I need
          To see me through</p>
        <p class="text">When food is gone you are my daily meal, oh
          When friends are gone I know my savior's love is real
          Your love is real
          'Cause you got the love
          You got the love
          You got the love
          You got the love
          You got the love
          You got the love</p>
